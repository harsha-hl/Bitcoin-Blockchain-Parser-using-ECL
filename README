Steps To Run

1. Run "make" to build the executable file for Linux Systems and "mingw32-make" in Windows system.
2. Run the executable file by passing the directory path with the .blk files. For Example : ./blockchain.out <path-to data folder> 
3. Set the maximum number of blocks to scan by using "max_blocks <number of blocks> ".
4. Use the option "scan" to start scanning the number of blocks specified.
5. Use the option "process" to link input addresses of transactions.
6. In order the view a particular block's transactions. Use the option "block <block-number>"

This is a minimal C++ code snippet to read the bitcoin block chain one by one into memory.

It is comprised of just two source files; a header file describing the bitcoin blockchain
data layout and an implementation CPP.  They are, combined, only a few hundred lines of
source and the bulk of both source files is really just comments.


The header file can be browsed here.  BlockChain.h

And the implementation here: BlockChain.cpp


This sample contains no code which actually interprets the *meaning* of that data; it just gets
it loaded into a data structure suitable for further processing.   Most likely in any future
articles I publish on this topic you will see examples of how to extract the meaning of this
raw data into data structures suitable for analysis.


This code uses no memory allocation, no STL, no BOOST, no containers, and it is only a couple
of hundreds lines of C++.  It does use hard-coded arrays with fixed limits in their sizes.
This is because the actual data in the bitcoin blockchain does not ever exceed certain limits;
so to avoid a great deal of unnecessary memory allocation this parser uses fixed buffers instead.


It is also pretty fast though, I suppose, it could be made faster, but not by a lot.  Some people
might point out that it could be made faster if it cached the source block-chain file but, really,
virtually all operating systems do that under the hood any way so I doubt it would make much difference.
As it is, it reads one bitcoin blockchain 'block' into memory at a time, parses the transactions,
inputs, and outputs, and returns them to the caller.  A person who might use this code snippet would,
most likely, take this data and convert it into some other more reasonable format for further processing
and analysis.  At least that's what I plan to do.


It is important to note that this code assumes that you are running on a small-endian machine, like
an X86.  It *does not* run on big-endian machines (like a PowerPC for example).  If you have a big-endian
machine, what can I say, get a real processor.


This code snippet is just a single header file and a single CPP.  In theory it should compile on any platform,
all you have to do is revise a couple of typedefs at the top of the header to declare the basic int sizes on
your platform. That's it.  It doesn't use the STL, Boost, or another heavyweight dependencies above and beyond
standard library type stuff.


 One problem with Jame's specification is that it's not always super clear what the hierarchy of the input
 data is; I hope that the classes in this header file make this a bit more clear.


An important note, a number of the inputs in the blockchain are marked as 'variable length integers'
(presumably to 'save space' even though they really don't) The variable length integer is capable of being
as large as 64 bits but, in actuality, never is. That's why all of the integers in the following data structures
are 32 bits in size instead; simply for the sake of simplicity.  This sample runs just fine compiled for 32 bit.


A couple of items; sometimes you can run out of blockchain data before you reach the end of the file.  What
I discovered is that past a certain point the file just contains zeroes.


There are also many cases where the actual data in the block is a lot less than the reported block-length.
I'm going to assume that this too is normal and expected.
